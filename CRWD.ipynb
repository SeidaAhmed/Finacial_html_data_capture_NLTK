These payroll taxes will be excluded from CrowdStrike's non-GAAP results as they are tied to the timing and size of the vesting or exercise of the underlying stock-based awards and the price of CrowdStrike's common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of CrowdStrike's business. Employer payroll taxes related to employee stock-based award transactions amounted to $42.2 million in fiscal 2025.Also effective in presenting periods starting on and after February 1, 2025, CrowdStrike will use a long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5% for the purpose of determining non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike per share to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods in fiscal 2026 and beyond. Given the significant growth of the company's business and non-GAAP operating income, CrowdStrike believes this change is necessary to better reflect the performance of its business. CrowdStrike will continue to assess the appropriateness of the non-GAAP tax rate on a regular basis, which could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the company's geographic earnings mix, or other changes to its strategy or business operations. The estimated impact of the non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5% to the outlook for non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, diluted, is $(0.19) and $(0.98) at the midpoint for Q1 FY26 and full year FY26, respectively.Please refer to the \"\n",
