Our success in the quarter brought all of this together with the power of our Customer 360 platform, the resilience of our business model, putting our customers first and doing our part to take care of all of our stakeholders. We know that together we have an opportunity to emerge from these times even stronger.”Salesforce delivered the following results for its fiscal second quarter:Revenue: Total second quarter revenue was $5.15 billion, an increase of 29% year-over-year, and 29% in constant currency.

GAAP diluted earnings per share was also benefited by $2.17 as the company changed its international corporate structure, which included the consolidation of intangible property, resulting in a $2 billion net tax benefit related to foreign deferred tax assets.  Please note that this had no impact on Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, as the company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate, which generally excludes effects for discrete events.Cash: Cash generated from operations for the second quarter was $0.43 billion, a decrease of 2% year-over-year.

non-gaap diluted earnings per share was $0.33 .  the company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 in the amount of $149 million to establish a valuation allowance against a significant portion of its deferred tax assets. this accounting treatment reflects the company’s assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realizable in the near-future, but has no effect on the company’s ability to utilize deferred tax assets, such as loss carryforwards and tax credits, to reduce future cash tax payments. the company will continue to assess and record any necessary quarterly changes to the valuation allowance and the corresponding income tax expense or benefit.  the company’s non-gaap results exclude the effects of the $149 million charge related to the establishment of the tax valuation allowance, $26 million related to the quarterly change in the tax valuation allowance, $105 million in stock-based compensation expense, $26 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, and $6 million in net non-cash interest expense related to the company’s convertible senior notes. gaap eps calculations are based on a

related to acquisitions, expected to be approximately $21 million, and net non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes, expected to be approximately $6  million .  eps estimates

lowering of the gaap net loss per share range is primarily as a result of the non-cash tax expense in q3 as discussed above. the non-gaap estimate excludes the effects of the fiscal third quarter
