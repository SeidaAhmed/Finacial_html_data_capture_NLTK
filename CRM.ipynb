Our success in the quarter brought all of this together with the power of our Customer 360 platform, the resilience of our business model, putting our customers first and doing our part to take care of all of our stakeholders. We know that together we have an opportunity to emerge from these times even stronger.”Salesforce delivered the following results for its fiscal second quarter:Revenue: Total second quarter revenue was $5.15 billion, an increase of 29% year-over-year, and 29% in constant currency. Subscription and support revenues for the quarter were $4.84 billion, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Professional services and other revenues for the quarter were $0.31 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. Earnings per Share: Second quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.85, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.44. Mark-to-market accounting of the company’s strategic investments, required by ASU 2016-01, benefited GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.55 based on a U.S. tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.58 based on a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. GAAP diluted earnings per share was also benefited by $2.17 as the company changed its international corporate structure, which included the consolidation of intangible property, resulting in a $2 billion net tax benefit related to foreign deferred tax assets.  Please note that this had no impact on Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, as the company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate, which generally excludes effects for discrete events.Cash: Cash generated from operations for the second quarter was $0.43 billion, a decrease of 2% year-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the second quarter at $9.28 billion.Remaining Performance Obligation: Remaining performance obligation ended the second quarter at approximately $30.6 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation ended the second quarter at approximately $15.2 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year, 24% in constant currency. As of August 25, 2020, the company is initiating its revenue guidance, GAAP earnings per share guidance, non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, and current remaining performance obligation growth guidance for its third quarter of fiscal year 2021. As of August 25, 2020, the company is raising its revenue guidance, GAAP earnings per share guidance, non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, and operating cash flow guidance previously provided on May 28, 2020 for its full fiscal year 2021.  Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call, which is expected to occur on August 25, 2020 at 2:00 PM Pacific Time.Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the company's strategic investment portfolio resulting from ASU 2016-01 as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to future acquisitions or other transactions.

The pandemic showed us that digital is an imperative for every company, and we’re confident Salesforce will continue to accelerate as we bring our customers into the new normal.”In response to COVID-19, Salesforce took the following actions in its fiscal first quarter to invest in its customers, employees and community during this unprecedented time, and to prepare for the future:•Launched Salesforce Care, a set of free rapid response solutions to help companies stay connected to their employees, customers and partners during the COVID-19 crisis•Created the Tableau Data Hub, a free resource to help companies and governments around the world see and understand data about the pandemic•Developed an online leadership program called Leading Through Change.

In the second fiscal quarter, the company introduced Work.com, new technology solutions and resources to help business and community leaders around the world reopen safely, re-skill employees and respond efficiently on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic. Work.com has generated enormous interest from businesses and governments and deepened partnerships with the world’s top system integrators and technology partners. For example, Workday recently announced that it will integrate its employee data directly into Work.com to make it easier for employers to centralize critical data and get their businesses up and running again.Salesforce delivered the following results for its fiscal first quarter:Revenue: Total first quarter revenue was $4.87 billion, an increase of 30% year-over-year, and 31% in constant currency.

Professional services and other revenues for the quarter were $290 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Earnings per Share: First quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.11, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.70. Mark-to-market accounting of the company’s strategic investments, required by ASU 2016-01, benefited GAAP earnings per share by $0.16 based on a U.S. tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.16 based on a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%.Cash: Cash generated from operations for the first quarter was $1.86 billion, a decrease of 5% year-over-year.

Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call, which is expected to occur on May 28, 2020 at 2:00 PM Pacific Time.Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the company's strategic investment portfolio resulting from ASU 2016-01 as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

The non-GAAP estimate excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, expected to be approximately $139 million, amortization of purchased intangibles related to acquisitions, expected to be approximately $36 million, and net non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes, expected to be approximately $10 million.  EPS estimates assume a GAAP tax rate of approximately negative 36%, which reflects the estimated quarterly change in the tax valuation allowance, and a projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5%.  Note that the tax valuation allowance adds complexity, causing potential volatility in our forecasted GAAP tax rate.  The GAAP EPS calculation assumes an average basic share count of approximately 618 million shares, and the non-GAAP EPS calculation assumes an average fully diluted share count of approximately 655 million shares.Full Year FY15 Guidance:  Revenue for the company’s full fiscal year 2015 is projected to be in the range of $5.30 billion to $5.34 billion, an increase of 30% to 31% year-over-year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be in the range of ($0.49) to ($0.47) while diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51.  The non-GAAP estimate excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, expected to be approximately $578 million, amortization of purchased intangibles related to acquisitions, expected to be approximately $149 million, net non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes, expected to be approximately $38 million, and loss on conversions of the convertible senior notes, expected to be approximately $9 million.  EPS estimates assume a GAAP tax rate of approximately negative 21%, which reflects the estimated annual change in the tax valuation allowance, and a projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5%. Note that the tax valuation allowance adds complexity, causing potential volatility in our forecasted GAAP tax rate.  The GAAP EPS calculation assumes an average basic share count of approximately 622 million shares, and the non-GAAP EPS calculation assumes an average fully diluted share count of approximately 658 million shares.The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP EPS to diluted non-GAAP EPS guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year: Fiscal 2015 Q2 FY2015GAAP EPS Range*($0.13) – ($0.12) ($0.49) – ($0.47)Plus   Amortization of purchased intangibles$0.05 $0.23Stock-based expense$0.21 $0.88Amortization of debt discount, net$0.02 $0.07Less   Income tax effects and adjustments**$(0.04) $(0.20)Non-GAAP diluted EPS$0.11 – $0.12 $0.49 – $0.51Shares used in computing basic net income per share (millions)618 622Shares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions)655 658 *For Q2 and FY15 GAAP EPS loss, basic number of shares used for calculation.**Beginning in FY15, the company's non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 36.5%.Quarterly \n",

valuation allowance against a significant portion of its deferred tax assets. this accounting treatment reflects the company’s assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realizable in the near-future, but has no effect on the company’s ability to utilize deferred tax assets, such as loss carryforwards and tax credits, to reduce future cash tax payments. the company will continue to assess and record any necessary quarterly changes to the valuation allowance and the corresponding income tax expense or benefit.  the company’s non-gaap results exclude the effects of the $149
